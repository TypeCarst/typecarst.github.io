Thanks for your interest in my activities. I'm Carsten a Software Developer from Germany. 

My career started with a B.Sc. in Computer Science at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin during which I concentrated on Game Development and Computer Graphics. This resulted in two group projects to create games and an internship which gave me the opportunity to work on a title released back in 2013. 

To gain some more practical experience I worked fulltime in a team on an SAP Business One AddOn. During this time I could improve my C# skills.

I decided to attend a master's course due to my desire to learn more in 2015. The focus of my studies were Augmented Reality, image processing and some machine learning at the end. My studies are about to end and I'm looking forward to new opportunities to show and improve my skills.
