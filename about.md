Thanks for your interest in my activities. I'm Carsten Flöth, a Software Developer from Germany. 

My career started with a B.Sc. in Computer Science at the Freie Universität Berlin where I concentrated on Game Development and Computer Graphics. This resulted in two group projects to create games and an internship which gave me the opportunity to work on a title released back in 2013. 

To gain some more practical experience I worked fulltime in a team on an SAP Business One AddOn. During this time I could improve my C# skills.

I decided to attend a master's course due to my desire to learn more in 2015. The focus of my studies were image processing, medical image processing and some machine learning at the end.

Currently I'm a VR software developer at WeAre GmbH and started there in May 2018. We are developing the VR solution WeAre Rooms mainly for machine manufactureres. With it they are able to locate issues before production and this with colleagues all over the world in a virtual room. I'm focussing on VR interactions, the desktop mode and graphical features.
